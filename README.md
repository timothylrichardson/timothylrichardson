# Hi, I'm Timothy! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a developer passionate about **AI experimentation**, **cloud technologies**, and building practical solutions. Currently diving into AWS, MultiCloud architectures, and LLMs like LLaMA.

## What I'm Working On

- **Cloud Skills**: Building with AWS ([cloud-synapse](https://github.com/timothylrichardson/cloud-synapse)).
- **Java Development**: Crafting tools like [tither](https://github.com/timothylrichardson/tither).
- **MultiCloud Journey**: Documenting progress on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@yourusername) with backups here.
